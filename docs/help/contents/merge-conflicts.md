# Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when there are conflicting note edits on your devices for the same note. 

Lets suppose that you have two devices running Notesnook: 1. a desktop and 2. a mobile. Suppose that one of your devices is offline (in this case your mobile phone). Now if you make edits to the same note on both your devices and then synched them both a merge conflict will occur.
